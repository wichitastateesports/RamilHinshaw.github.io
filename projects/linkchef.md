description: This was a concept project to recreate the dialouge in ocarina of time and understanding linked lists and events. Since I love the Legend of Zelda franchise I went all out on this project and created everything from scratch. For copyright reasons this Link is not the hero of time but the Chef of Hyrule. Also a reference to my friend's internet alias.

Project Linkchef
================

This may look like a familiar game to you. I did this as a quick project to practice my 3D modeling and programming skills. Its Link from the Zelda franchise but instead of the hero of Hyrule he is just a chef. I followed this video to create this character https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhc2SRAWDc  (I create all my human low-poly models in this kind of workflow)

Most of the things in the game were modeled, animated, and programmed by me. I did the ground textures in ms paint XD

The main highlight of this game was the dialogue system I created in this. Works similar like the original game.
