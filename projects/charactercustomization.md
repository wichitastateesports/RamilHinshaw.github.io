description: This is my initial concept project on how to use blendshapes in Unity's GameEngine for character customization. Surprisingly there were no documentation on this on the web at the time nor was there any on youtube so I dived down programmed an optimal way of achieving this. There is now a video of it on youtube with my Alias as Glauz.

Character Customization
================

###Blendshape testing with my own custom models :)
This is my project to test blendshapes with sliders. I create a tutorial video on how to do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypRhJAfJXAc Everything in this game was done by scratch. I 3D modeled and textured the characters, houses, etc. The white mark there just represents there is an empty slot I can use for accessories like glasses or jewelry.

Here you can see the face change based on the slider. The white mark on the forehead is just a placeholder showing its an empty slot for item/accessories (like earrings, glasses, and what not)

Made a lot of different characters as a result, haven't done much with this project. Hope I can come back to this in the future.
